# docx4j-export-FO
Export docx to PDF via XSL FO, using FOP

Up until docx4j v3.3.0, this was part of docx4j itself.  From 3.3.0 onwards, it is an optional separate sub-project.

In v3.3.0, the default PDF Converter is an eval version of Plutext's commercial renderer, which offers
better fidelity and performance.

v6.x series is the last which will support Java 6.
